# Exercise-3

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

#touch

The `touch` command creates a file in the current directory. For example:

`touch new-file.r`

Some other functions of `touch`:

- `touch -d date_time`, use the date_time specified to update the access and modification times
- `touch -c`, if the file does not exist, do not create it and do not report this condition





See `complete` branch for answers.
